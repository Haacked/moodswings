# Mood Swings

We code in all sorts of different environments. Sometimes we blast Norwegian Death metal and need our editor to be dark. Other times we're presenting in front of an audience and need our font size larger.

This package adjusts Visual Studio to fit your current mood. It's available on https://nuget.org/

## Installation

From the Visual Studio Package Manager Console

```ps
Install-Package moodswings
